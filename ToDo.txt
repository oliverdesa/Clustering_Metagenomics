Finishing up the break, What I need to do this week

04/01/2024

- Put together and create a small presentation of the protein purification to show dana
- Write down some points of potential next steps
- take inventory of all the trial patients 
	- How many do I have completed?
	- find names of those missing, check if filt reads exist, if not re-download from scratch
- Finish the metadata sheet 
- Test applying the clustering, take notes and important info.
	- How many clusters are being made? How many idividual protein do each of these clusters contain?
- download and run the bariatric data, might have to check how many of the files are potentially missing

05/01/2024

- queued up the remaining reads for kneaddata (Done, Failed)
- clustered PRJEB7774 and applied maaslin
	- 1 significant cluster when doing raw maaslin on relab data
	- ~9 sig clusters when doing CLR maaslin on relab data
	- raw maaslin might be taking into account the actual abundaces better, hard to tell
	- CLR normalization has very low N not 0, looks like a bug with maaslin but not sure. 
- Make a process to look deeper into differentially abundant clusters;
	- what taxa are they mostly coming from?
	- what domains/sec tags do proteins in that cluster typically have? (Running now)
	- visualize the cluster changes between patients
	- make function to easily pull initial proteins collected under a cluster (Done)
	
- Cluster and run Maaslin2 on PRJEB10878
	- Look for repeatedly downregulated clusters

08/02/2024

- Combined and ran DA on Large CRC dataset
- in the pooled, CLR normalized analysis, LD-carboxys are downregulated in early stage patients (p=0.0305281909265825, q=0.24422552741266) (Not that important)
- In analysis, stage 1/2 are characterized as early stage, 3/4 are late stage. HS and MP seperate from healthy, might have to combine those into simply cancer vs no cancer
- signalp and IPS are finished and downloaded to OneDrive, need to make some functions.
	- How do Secreted DLEs change?
	- What are the domains/secretion tags of the clusters? (do it for all to make it easier)

09/01/2024

- Start by building function to grab number of DLE per cluster, domains + secretion tag calculations/cluster make a csv to easily map and build figures
- test out random forest stuff
- issues with cluster mapping, only 1879 of 1960 original proteins seem to be mapping all the way to foldseek clusters. 
- Created function to pull the amount of protiens stored within each cluster
- crreated a function to annotation secretion tags based on uniref ID
- Could technically do DA testing on secrreted only DLEs. 
- Should apply DA testing with clustering on PRJEB10878
