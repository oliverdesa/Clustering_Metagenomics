Finishing up the break, What I need to do this week

- Put together and create a small presentation of the protein purification to show dana
- Write down some points of potential next steps
- take inventory of all the trial patients
	- How many do I have completed?
	- find names of those missing, check if filt reads exist, if not re-download from scratch
- Finish the metadata sheet
- Test applying the clustering, take notes and important info.
	- How many clusters are being made? How many idividual protein do each of these clusters contain?
- download and run the bariatric data, might have to check how many of the files are potentially missing
-
