Finishing up the break, What I need to do this week

04/01/2024

- Put together and create a small presentation of the protein purification to show dana
- Write down some points of potential next steps
- take inventory of all the trial patients 
	- How many do I have completed?
	- find names of those missing, check if filt reads exist, if not re-download from scratch
- Finish the metadata sheet 
- Test applying the clustering, take notes and important info.
	- How many clusters are being made? How many idividual protein do each of these clusters contain?
- download and run the bariatric data, might have to check how many of the files are potentially missing

05/01/2024

- queued up the remaining reads for kneaddata (Done, Failed)
- clustered PRJEB7774 and applied maaslin
	- 1 significant cluster when doing raw maaslin on relab data
	- ~9 sig clusters when doing CLR maaslin on relab data
	- raw maaslin might be taking into account the actual abundaces better, hard to tell
	- CLR normalization has very low N not 0, looks like a bug with maaslin but not sure. 
- Make a process to look deeper into differentially abundant clusters;
	- what taxa are they mostly coming from?
	- what domains/sec tags do proteins in that cluster typically have? (Running now)
	- visualize the cluster changes between patients
	- make function to easily pull initial proteins collected under a cluster (Done)
	
- Cluster and run Maaslin2 on PRJEB10878
	- Look for repeatedly downregulated clusters

08/02/2024

- Combined and ran DA on Large CRC dataset
- in the pooled, CLR normalized analysis, LD-carboxys are downregulated in early stage patients (p=0.0305281909265825, q=0.24422552741266) (Not that important)
- In analysis, stage 1/2 are characterized as early stage, 3/4 are late stage. HS and MP seperate from healthy, might have to combine those into simply cancer vs no cancer
- signalp and IPS are finished and downloaded to OneDrive, need to make some functions.
	- How do Secreted DLEs change?
	- What are the domains/secretion tags of the clusters? (do it for all to make it easier)

09/01/2024

- Start by building function to grab number of DLE per cluster, domains + secretion tag calculations/cluster make a csv to easily map and build figures
- test out random forest stuff
- issues with cluster mapping, only 1879 of 1960 original proteins seem to be mapping all the way to foldseek clusters. 
- Created function to pull the amount of protiens stored within each cluster
- crreated a function to annotation secretion tags based on uniref ID
- Could technically do DA testing on secreted only DLEs. 
- Should apply DA testing with clustering on PRJEB10878

10/01/2024

- Tried to do DA testing on PRJEB10878 but metadata was lost on old ssd. Metadata download doesnt seem to include patient conditions
- Re-assess clustering function for secretion annotation and protein counts
- SOLVED, some proteins do not have their 3d structured annotated yet so are ignored in the foldseek clustering process. Most are singletons and havent been seen in any of the shotgun data yet. Can submit a job to get those 3d structures predicted for completion sake. 

11/01/2024

- Today, prepare some figures for meeting with Dana and meeting with charlie.
- Make a pooled DA testing figure to compare with the clustered data. (DONE)
- Train some models on the pooled and clustering data then print out some figures. (Move this to later)
- Display some info on cluster secretion tags, domains if possible.
- make figures of PRJEB7774 and look for common clusters. (Fig made, look for common clusters)
- Plan to make comparisons;
	- pull tables from 8156 and 7774 from heatmap script, pull common clusters that are downregulated. 
	- use that to look at secretion, % secreted per cluster.
